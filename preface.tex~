\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was prepared at Informatics Mathematical Modelling,
the Technical University of Denmark in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for acquiring the bachelor's degree in engineering.

%The thesis deals with different aspects of mathematical modeling of
%systems using data and partial knowledge about the structure of the
%systems.  The main focus is on extensions of non-parametric methods,
%but also stochastic differential equations and neural networks are
%considered.

%The thesis consists of a summary report and a collection of ten
%research papers written during the period 1996--1999, and elsewhere
%published.

\paragraph{Declaration of independent research.} Finally it is certified that this thesis is written by myself in full, and with citation clearly sourced where due.

\subsection*{Glossary}

\subsubsection*{Rejsekort(et)}
Danish for ``travel card'' or ``the travel card,'' a new Mifare-based ticketing system for public transportation in Denmark.

The language if this thesis is English, but still the Danish conjugations of the substantive ``Rejsekort'' are used. In Danish the definite and indefinite article is the same, and for a neuter word like Rejsekort it is ``et.'' The difference is that the definite article goes \emph{after} the word instead of before like in other languages. That entails that ``Rejsekortet'' is the definite version ``Rejsekort.'' In addition, the plural of ``Rejsekort'' is ``Rejsekort.''

\subsubsection*{RKF, Rejsekortsforeningen}
A Swedish company responsible for development of Rejsekortet.

\subsubsection*{Rejsekort A/S}
A Danish company responsible for implementing and developing the travel card standard set by RKF, as well as rolling the solution out nationwide.
