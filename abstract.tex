This bachelor thesis explores the possibility of synchronizing rendering over a network. 
\\

One possible solution for achieving synchronization is presented in the form of a demonstration program written in Python. This solution combines several different known solutions and algorithms. The design choices for the demonstration program is explained and evaluated as well as the chosen algorithms.
