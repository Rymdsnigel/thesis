This bachelor thesis explores the possibility of synchronizing rendering over a network. The need to synchronize rendering occurs since projectors have a limited resolution. To achieve a specific higher resolution the rendering of an animation needs to be divided over several projectors. If these projectors are connected to different computers the rendering needs to be synchronized. 
\\

The thesis explores different techniques and algorithms for achieving synchronization and presents one possible solution in a demo program written in Python. The design choices for the demo are explained and evaluated as well as the chosen algorithms.
