\end{center}
This bachelor thesis explores the possibility to synchronize rendering over an network. The need to synchronize rendering occurs since projectors have a limited resolution. To achieve a specific higher resolution the rendering of an animation needs to be divided over several projectors. If these projectors are connected to different computers the rendering needs to be synchronized. 
\\

The thesis will explore different teqniques and algorithms for achieving synchronization and present one possible solution in a demo program written i python. The design choices for the demo will be explained and evaluated aswell as the choosen algorithms.
