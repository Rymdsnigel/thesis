\chapter{Summary}

This thesis was written in the spring of 2013. It is an investigation into different solutions on how to sychronize rendering on different computers over a network. A possible use case is to manage animations that need to combine a number of monitors to achieve a desired resolution, since monitors have a limited area. The specifications require the possibility to distribute events in real time to all rendering parts, for example by turning a knob on a mixer-table. The event message should contain parameters for the animation that the rendering parts should render. The rendering of these events should also be synchronized. 

Different solutions on how to achieve synchronization have been investigated. A possible solution written in Python is presented. This solution is implemented using a combination of well known algorithms and solutions.
