\chapter{Summary}

This thesis was written in the spring of 2013. It is an investigation into different solutions on how to sychronize rendering on different computers over a network. A possible use case is to manage projections that needs to combine a number of projectors to achieve a desired resolution, since projectors have a limited resolution. The specifications also required the possibility to distribute events to all rendering parts, for example by turning a knob on a mixer-table. The event message could for example contain parameters for the animation that the rendering parts should render. The rendering of these events should also be synchronized. 

Different solutions on how to achieve synchronizations has been investigated, starting with the solution implemented using a combination of well known algorithms and solutions.
