\chapter{Summary}

This thesis was written in the spring of 2013. It is an investigation into different solutions on how to sychronize rendering, on different computers, over an network. A possible use case is to manage projections that needs to combine a number of projectors to achieve a desired resolution, since projectors have a limited resolution. 

Different solutions on how to achieve synchronizations has been investigated, starting with the solution implemented in the NTP-protocol.
