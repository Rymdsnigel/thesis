\subsection{The Berkley algorithm}
The Berkley algorithm was written by Gusella and Zatti in 1989.

%OMFG you need references for this!!!
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item A master polls slaves, the slaves replies with their time.
    \item The master uses the round-trip time of the messages to estimate the time of each slave and the masters own time.
    \item The master calculates an average of the clock times, ignoring extreme values.
    \item The master sends the slaves their delta, which can be positive or negative.

The delta values that the slaves recieves can be used to create an local time
