\subsection{Cristians algorithm}
Cristians algorithm\cite{cristian}, developed in 1989 by Flaviu Cristian, is used for synchronizing clocks by calculating the round trip time. It is a probabilistic algorithm\cite{cristian}, meaning that it it delivers a better accuracy the shorter the round trip delay time is. 

The algorithm works as follows. The server sends a message to the client, and the client replies. When the server recieves the reply from the client it calculates the round trip delay time, that is, the time passed between sending the request from the server and recieving the reply from the client divided by 2. This assumes that the latency of the server and the client is equal.

The server then sends the sum of its own time added with the round trip delay time to the client, and the client sets this as its own time.
