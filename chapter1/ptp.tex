\subsection{PTP and GPS}

The Precision Time Protocol, abbriviates PTP, is a protocol used for high accuracy synchronization in time critical systems. The first RTC is from 2002. Although PTP achieves very high synchronization it was believed in the making of this thesis that synchronizing rendering would not require that kind of precision. 

One other solution for synchronizing the time of distributed applications is to use GPS. This has not been investigated further in this thesis since this would require that all clients had a GPS-sender/reciever, something that seemed improbable.
