\subsection{PTP and GPS}

The Precision Time Protocol, abbriviates PTP, is a protocol used for high accuracy synchronization in time critical systems. The first RTC is from 2002. PTP achieves a very high level of synchronization but it was assumed in the making of this thesis that this kind of precision would not be needed. 

One additional solution for synchronizing the time of distributed applications is to use GPS. Since this would require that all clients had a GPS-sender/reciever, something that seemed improbable, GPS was not further investigated as a solution in this thesis.
