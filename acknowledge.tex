\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank 23 Critters, especially Mathias Tervo and Kristoffer Smedlund, for presenting me with the problem and having great patience in discussing it with me. 

% I suppose there will be a lot of people to thank for this.

Finally I would like to thank Sanna Barsk for the extensive proof-reading of this thesis.
