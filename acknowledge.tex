\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank 23 Critters, especially Mathias Tervo and Kristoffer Smedlund, for presenting me with the problem and having great patience in discussing it with me. I would also like to thank Minna Morri, the worlds best lab partner, for her support and not only in the making of this thesis. 

Finally I would like to thank Sanna Barsk for the extensive proof-reading of this thesis.
