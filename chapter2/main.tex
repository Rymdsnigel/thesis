\chapter{The Demo}

This section aims to explain the overall architecture and choices made for the demo, specific solutions for synchronization will be presented in the next chapter. 

All code is available at github: https://github.com/Rymdsnigel/thesis-demo

\section{Running the programs}
The demo program is written in python 2.7.2. It requires pygame 1.9.1, simplejson 2.1.6, docopt 0.6.1 and gevent 0.13.0.

\section{Overall architecture}
The demo program consists of a server that continously accept connecting clients.

\subsection{Why the Client-Server approach?}
Because there was a need to both generate and distribute specific events the client-server approach were chosen, rather than choosing a master among the clients, which might have been a more flexible choice if the generation of events had not been in the specification. The downside of this is that if the server should crash, the clients will loose their connection, the connection will not be reestablished by restarting the server.

\section{Design choises}

\input{chapter2/transport.tex}

\subsection{Threading}
\label{sec:threading}

Both the server and the client has to achieve concurrency. This is achieved by letting both the TransportServers and the TransportClients inherit from gevent Greenlets %ref. 
Greenlets are in fact pseudothreads %ref
that share the same OS-thread so to release the control the threads must sleep on time critical operations to not block all other threads. 


\subsection{Messaging}
The server and clients sends and recieves json, the json is created using simplejson-library functions (dumps() and loads()), creating json from dicts. The functions for generating the dicts that will be the messages are specified in event.py. 

The choice of json for messaging, instead of using pickle or cpickle to read and write messages was made due to jsons speed of reading and writing \footnote{\url{http://kovshenin.com/2010/pickle-vs-json-which-is-faster/}, Kovshenin} and to support future flexibility in language since pickle and cpickle is python-specific. 

\subsection{Pygame}

Pygame, which is built on SDL(ref:http://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) was choosen for graphics due to its simplicity to work with.
