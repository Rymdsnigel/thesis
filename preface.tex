\chapter{Preface}

This thesis was written at 23c in Stockholm as the completion of my bachelors degree in Computer Engineering from The Royal Institute of Technology in Kista. It was started in March of 2013 and consists of 15 ECTS points. 

It presents a possible solution on how to synchronize the rendering processes on different computers over a network. 

This thesis and the code presented has been written by me and in the cases where other sources has been used this is clearly cited.

Network Time Protocol, used to synchronize computer clocks over an network. 

\subsubsection*{Frameskipping}
Skipping forward a certain number of frames in an animation.

\subsubsection*{Tweening}
Also known as inbetweening. Technique for creating linear animations by defining the start and the end states of the animation. 

\subsubsection*{Timestep}
