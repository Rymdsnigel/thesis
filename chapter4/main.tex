\chapter{Synchronizing the clients}

The synchronization of the animations have two major steps. First of all we have a continously running animation that takes input from the Tween class. This animation could be synchronized by giving every client a notion of how much delay there is between that client and a master, a master that could be the server.

The second step where to adapt the time the clients played specific parts of the animation when recieving a render event message from the server. Here we also faced the challange that one client could have a latency bigger than we could accept so that we would have to adjust this client some other way. A solution for this was implemented using frameskipping.
