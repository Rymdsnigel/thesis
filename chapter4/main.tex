\chapter{Synchronizing the clients}

The synchronization of the animations has two major steps. First of all there is a continously running animation that takes input from the Tween class. This animation can be synchronized by giving every client a notion of how much delay there is between that client and a master, a master which could be the server.

The second step is to adapt the time the clients play specific parts of the animation when recieving a render event message from the server. An optimization of this is to frameskip the clients that are slower than a specified threshold.
